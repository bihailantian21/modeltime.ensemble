Description: 
    A 'modeltime' extension that implements time series ensemble forecasting methods including model averaging, 
    weighted averaging, and linear stacking using penalized regression. These techniques are popular methods 
    to improve forecast accuracy and stability. Refer to papers such as
    Pavlyshenko, B.M. Machine-Learning Models for Sales Time Series Forecasting. Data 2019, 4, 15.
